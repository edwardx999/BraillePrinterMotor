x is the x coordinate of the print head.
The y coordinate is irrelevant as the head does not move vertically. 
It should be replaced with a read as to whether the paper is fed.
The z coordinate therefore is also irrelevant.

x will be increment until the max number of rows is reached 
	(this max number could be made dynamic with a sensor).
Then the paper will be spooled by one row and the head will be returned to x=0.
If there is no more paper, printing is paused.
